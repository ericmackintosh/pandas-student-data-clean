    "Because we have two different types of learning outcomes metrics: 15 pre and post questions, designed to be administered BEFORE and AFTER studying abroad - these are questions such as “I am aware of how my home government policies are viewed in my host country” and “I’m aware of where the products I consume are produced and understand their environmental impact” - students rate these on level of agreement 1-10, the idea is that their study abroad experience will increase their understanding and cultural awareness, increasing their scores, and creating a greater % difference between pre (the start of their programs) and post (the end). The second type of learning is goal attainment. Pre-departure students are asked to list the goals they wish to accomplish while abroad [select from list], then after their programs end, they are asked to list the goals they accomplished while abroad [select from list]). Because of this, we will want a few different calculations. \n",

    "Per program, we want to calculate the percentage of participants that managed to attain the goals they selected on both the pre- and post- program surveys. Goal attainment is indicated using INT fields. For example, if a student selected that a goal is to \"develope new skills\", then in that field a \"1\" is present. All questions are in the same order, both pre and post. So, if a student selected the goal is to \"Develope New Skills\" in both the pre, and post, the aggregate of the two fields should be \"2\", so then we would flag that with a \"1\"-\n",
