# Pandas CRM/Survey Data Clean for Tableau
I developed a dashboard allowing stakeholders (principally the sales team) to quickly pull data regarding student satisfaction (with our services) and learning metrics. Satisfaction data was also related to KPI metrics against which on-site (abroad offices) and domestic program managers were measured. Data is pulled from two sources, one was a local CRM, which was automated, using SQL, the other was Surveymonkey, pulled weekly. Surveymonkey data was cleaned using pandas and python. For this project, CRM data is masked using python. Finally, data is pushed into Tableau. Tableau Server was used in the past, but for this project, we will use Tableau Public.
