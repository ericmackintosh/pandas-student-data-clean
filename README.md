# Pandas CRM/Survey Data Clean for Tableau
I developed a dashboard in order to allow stakeholders (principally the sales team) to quickly pull data regarding student satisfaction (with our services) and learning metrics (associated with our onsite programming). Satisfaction data composes a part of our employee KPI (Key Performance Indicator) metrics, against which on-site (abroad offices) and domestic program managers are measured. Data is pulled from two sources; a local CRM, with an automated MS SQL Server datapull, the other, Surveymonkey, pulled weekly into CSV files. Surveymonkey data is cleaned using pandas and python. For this project, CRM data is masked using python. Finally, data is pushed into Tableau. Tableau Server was used in the past, but for this project, we will use Tableau Public.
